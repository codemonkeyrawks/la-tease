Usage:

This projects main goal is to take in users unparsed data (csv file) and parse this
to a nice uniform format such that for example Chart.js can use this for display. The 
project may use flask for API extraction and use Chart.js to display data.

Python:    Parse Some Fake Data 
Flask:     UI Back
Chart.js : UI Front

Project is under work still*
